# Plow CLI setup

<div className="steps-container">

### Installing Rust toolchain

To install the Plow CLI, currently an installation of a recent version of the [Rust language toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
is required.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info" emoji="🚧️">
  To provide an easier setup process that doesn't require installing the Rust toolchain, we are [working on providing pre-built binaries of the CLI](https://github.com/field33/plow/issues/1).
</Callout>

### Installing the Plow CLI binary

To install the Plow CLI via cargo, you can run in a terminal:
```sh copy filename="Shell"
cargo install plow_cli
```

After the installation is finished, you can verify that the binary is available via:

```sh copy filename="Shell"
plow --help
```

### Login to public registry

In order to take certain actions with the Plow CLI (e.g. publishing a package)
or to have access to private packages that have been shared with your Plow registry
account, you have to authenticate your installation of the CLI.

- Log in (or create an account) under [registry.field33.com](https://registry.field33.com)
- In your account settings create a new User Token, and copy it to your clipboard
- In a terminal run (substituting `[USER_TOKEN]` with the token from your clipboard):
  ```sh copy filename="Shell"
  plow login [USER_TOKEN]
  ```
